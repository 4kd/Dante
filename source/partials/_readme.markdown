#Dante Editor

###Just another Medium editor clone.

###Motivation:

####So far I have tried all the Medium.com wysiwyg clones out there, these are really great, and each have their pros and cons. [But none of them has all the features that the real medium editor provides.](http://howtox.com/medium-editor-clones-in-js/)
so I wonder, How complicated could be write my own Medium wysiwyg clone?

### This is a live demo:

This Library will work fine on latest versions of Chrome/Safari/FF/IE.
We don't have any intention to target all browsers versions, really... if you like this library and you need backward compatibility for an specific version you can submit a patch to help with the development or just upgrade your shitty browser :D

**BTW , this library is an official beta release, so there are known bugs that we are currently working on.**
